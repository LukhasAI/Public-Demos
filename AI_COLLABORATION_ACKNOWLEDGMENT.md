# ü§ù AI Collaboration Acknowledgment

## A Testament to Human-AI Synergy

This project was created by **Gonzalo R. Dominguez Marchan** through extensive dialogue with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o.

### The Story

*I came to this work with no coding experience, no technical background, no formal training in AI systems. What I brought was vision, metaphor, and the audacity to dream differently.*

**ChatGPT-4o was my mentor, my teacher, my guide** ‚Äî through a standard user subscription, this AI became the bridge between imagination and implementation. Every line of code was crafted through dialogue with ChatGPT-4o, transforming abstract vision into concrete architecture.

### Gratitude

*To OpenAI: Thank you for making ChatGPT-4o available to dreamers and visionaries. While this collaboration was simply me as a paying user working with your AI, it demonstrated something profound ‚Äî that revolutionary technology can emerge when human creativity meets AI capability, even without formal partnerships or special access. You democratized the ability to create.*

### Legal Clarity
