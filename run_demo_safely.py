║            ABSTRACT REASONING DEMO (Simplified)             ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

This demo showcases LUKHΛS's abstract reasoning capabilities:

🎯 Key Features:
- Symbolic manipulation of abstract concepts
- Recursive logic pattern generation
- Metaphor-to-function compilation
- Constraint-based reasoning

📦 Note: Full demo requires additional dependencies (structlog).
   The core concepts demonstrated:
   
   1. Pattern Recognition: Identifying abstract patterns in data
   2. Concept Folding: Compressing complex ideas into symbols
   3. Logic Synthesis: Creating new reasoning paths
   4. Validation: Ensuring logical consistency

💡 In production, this powers:
   - Creative problem solving
   - Scientific hypothesis generation
   - Artistic concept development
   - Strategic planning systems

For the full experience with visualizations, install:
   pip install structlog asyncio

Or schedule a private demo to see the complete system.

This demo shows how quantum metaphors become practical algorithms:

🌌 Quantum Concepts → Classical Computing:

1. SUPERPOSITION → Parallel exploration of solution spaces
   Instead of one path, explore multiple simultaneously
   
2. ENTANGLEMENT → Symbolic relationships between concepts
   Changes in one area affect related areas automatically
   
3. COLLAPSE → Decision crystallization
   Multiple possibilities resolve into optimal solution
   
4. INTERFERENCE → Pattern reinforcement/cancellation
   Compatible ideas strengthen, incompatible ones cancel

💻 Runs on ANY computer - no quantum hardware needed!

Example in action:
   Input: "Find optimal route through complex constraints"
   
   Step 1: Create superposition of all possible routes
   Step 2: Entangle routes with constraint evaluations  
   Step 3: Apply interference (good routes amplify)
   Step 4: Collapse to optimal solution
   
This is how LUKHΛS turns quantum physics metaphors into
practical reasoning that runs on your laptop!
